- create coroutine for using the translator (correcting errors, removing noise,
    creating sessions depending on the signals nature, tackling long pauses,
    detect activity)
- test with noise at the beginning
- test with long pauses between words/letters
- test non existent characters (signals -> morse -- problem --> alphabet)
- add long silence test
- same signal fractions test
- wrong signals test
- add README docs, install, usage, test, debug info etc.
